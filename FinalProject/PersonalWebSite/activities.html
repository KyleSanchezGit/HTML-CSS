            <h1 class="ac"> ACTIVITIES </h1>
            <p> This page is all about what keeps me grounded, mentally and physically. I like to lift weights, fish, and drive my custom car around town.
               When I can afford it, i'll take a Vacation somewhere with my girlfriend.
            </p>
            <h2 class= "bodybuild"  id="p1a">Bodybuilding</h2>
            <p>This is a way for me to connect with my physical strength. I love the gym because it's a hobby that
               people can tell just by looking at you. <img src="bb2.jpg" alt="kyle bodybuilding pose" class="bb2" id="bb2"/>
               Usually, you get instant respect from other people because
               of the dedication people know it takes to achieve. It's a way for me to constantly test myself and 
               learn what is really capable from my body. 
            </p>
            <h2 class="fish" id="p2a">Fishing</h2>
            <p>I love fishing because it's very relaxing, up until the point that you hook a fish. <br /> I like going to Les Davis
               Pier over off of Ruston Way in Tacoma. I use a medium-heavy  
               pole with 300LB braided line and use a dogfish as
               bait for big sharks.
               <br /> It's both terrifying, and exciting, knowing that a one hundred fifty pound shark is just at the end of your line!
            </p>
            <h2 class="subaru" id="p3a">Modifying my 2002 Subaru Impreza WRX</h2>
            <p>My first car was a 1987 Acura Legend when I was 17 years old. Ever since I got my first car, i've always been modifying my 
               cars. I usually go through a whole process when I buy a car and if needed, I replace regular maintenance items and then move to 
               the engine, transmission and exhaust mounts for stability. After I replace the stock items of the car, i'll put 
               money into the expensive horsepower adding parts, like exhaust and turbos.
            </p>
            <p> I owned a 1994 Acura Legend, 1993 Honda Civic EX, and a 1989 Foxbody Mustang GT. After I joined the Army in 2010
               I bought a 2008 Toyota FJ Cruiser and in late 2017 I bought my current 2002 Subaru Impreza WRX.
            </p>
            <h1 class="vacay"> VACATIONS </h1>
            <h2 class="vacayh1" id="vacayp1"> New Mexico </h2>
            <p> I joined the Army in 2010 out of Albuquerque, New Mexico. I was honorably discharged from the Army in 2017 and bought 
               my first home here in Washington State. <br /> My entire time in the Army, i've had to visit New Mexico about once a year because 
               I no longer live in the state. So about once a year I take a week long vacation back to my home desert of New Mexico.

            </p>
            <h2 class="vacayh2" id="vacayp2"> Clearwater Beach, Florida </h2>
            <p> My girlfriend and I are planning a 3 day trip to tripadvisors number one rated beach in the United States, Clearwater Beach,
               Florida. <br /> We will get there June 20th, 2019 and are staying on a hotel on the beach with my girlfriend's best friend and boyfriend. It's
               going to be a great fun filled weekend in the sun! 
            </p>
            <h2 class="vacayh3" id="vacayp3"> Paducah, Kentucky </h2>
            <p > My girlfriend grew up in Paducah, Kentucky and is similar to me, in that, she lives away from her home state. <br />
               Her mom, and brothers moved to Gig Harbor, Washington from Paducah in 2015 which is the same year I met her, except one of her brothers, Brenton.
               So every year she chooses to visit her Brother Brenton for Halloween in Paducah, Kentucky. Last year I went with her and it was a great time.
               We stayed at her brother Brenton's house with her sister in law. <img src="kentucky.jpg" alt="Melanie and Kyle in Kentucky" class="kentucky" id="kentucky"/>
               <img src="jefferson.jpg" alt="Melanie and Kyle in Kentucky" class="jefferson"/>
               <br />
               There is a street named Jefferson street in Paducah which is where the entire town of Paducah comes to trick-or-treat dressed up in their
               costumes and it's the entire town, so there is thousands of people on this one street, it's really something special.
