      <h1 class="choice" id="p1i">I Chose Software Development</h1>
      <p> because ever since I was thirteen years
         old, I've been building my own computers and playing XBOX. Computers have always been there
         for me when no one else was and for that, I truly appreciate all the technology. 
         It's also become increasingly obvious to me that Software runs the world! <br />
         Well, really it's 
         this symbiosis of hardware and software that runs the world. But the hardware side requires 
         more electrical engineering emphasis and I do not enjoy Calculus work. Programming, however,
         is quite enjoyable for me as I am skilled in English and like putting these english puzzle pieces
         together to make a computer do something.
