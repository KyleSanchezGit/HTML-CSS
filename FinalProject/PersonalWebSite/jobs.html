      <h1 class="dj">Dream Jobs</h1>
      <p>My dream jobs are: Freelance Coder, and Software Developer for Google and Amazon. </p>
      <h2 class="fc">Freelance Coder</h2>
      <p id="p1j">Being a master of all the different coding languages, companies contact me through my instagram or website
         to hire me for bits of code. Meanwhile I get to enjoy my home life, go to the gym on my own schedule, and make 
         my own schedule. <img src="freelance.jpg" alt="freelancer vs. employee" class="fr1" id="fr1" />
         <br />
         Basically, being a Freelance Coder would give me the freedom to make my own schedule and make
         money on my own terms. Financial freedom and Time Freedom, this is something all of us want from our job. Of 
         course, this type of job is unrealistic for a beginner in this undustry, but it is number one, in my dream jobs list. 
      </p>
      <h2 class="sd">Software Developer for Google</h2>
      <p id="p2j">I picked this job, because it's Google. How many people can say, in their lifetime that they worked for the 
         number one search engine on the planet. <br />
         I'm sure they pay well, have an enjoyable work environment, and there is 
         room for promotion. <img src="google.png" alt="google logo" class="goog1" id="goog1" />
      </p>
      <h2 class="sd2">Software Developer for Amazon</h2>
      <p id="p3j">It would be a real honor to help, or work on software programs for the company that I frequently buy products from.
         I use Amazon weekly to make orders, and learning how it works from the inside would really be a cool experience. I'm sure the pay and benefits
         are great and the work environment is probably enjoyable as well. <img src="amazon.png" alt="amazon logo" class="amazon1" id="amazon1" />
